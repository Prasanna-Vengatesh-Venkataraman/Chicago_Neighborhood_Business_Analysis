<p align="justify">Analysis of the different neighborhoods of Chicago. Collected the list of neighborhoods by web scraping Wikipedia and used Google API to determine their coordinates. Leveraged the different businesses information in each neighborhood using Foursquare API.  

Used K-Means algorithm to cluster the neighborhoods by determining similarity using the frequency of different businesses in each location. Created a visual map plot using Folium package and color coded each neighborhood depending on cluster label. Determined the frequency of businesses in each cluster and displayed the top and least 10 using a bar chart.
